(Your local Christian bookstore can suggest some books that describe cults in more detail.)\n\nOne characteristic is that cults reject the basic beliefs of the Christian faith–beliefs that Christians have held in common for almost 2,000 years. Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\n\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son. The Bible says, “Through him you believe in God … so your faith and hope are in God” (1 Peter 1:21).'}, 't1_l0gjysv': {'author': 'SnooDingos316', 'datetime': 1713625889.0, 'permalink': '/r/singapore/comments/1c8g16i/someone_pass_this_to_me_while_i_was_eating_alone/l0gjysv/', 'score': 4, 'subreddit': 'singapore', 'post_title': 'Someone pass this to me while I was eating alone at Woodlands', 'body': 'It is actually an Irony for you to say this because Christian claim they are the only true religion and they alone know the truth and reject all Muslims, Buddhist and even Catholics.

(Your local Christian bookstore can suggest some books that describe cults in more detail.)\n\nOne characteristic is that cults reject the basic beliefs of the Christian faith–beliefs that Christians have held in common for almost 2,000 years. Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\n\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son. The Bible says, “Through him you believe in God … so your faith and hope are in God” (1 Peter 1:21).'}, 't1_l0gjysv': {'author': 'SnooDingos316', 'datetime': 1713625889.0, 'permalink': '/r/singapore/comments/1c8g16i/someone_pass_this_to_me_while_i_was_eating_alone/l0gjysv/', 'score': 4, 'subreddit': 'singapore', 'post_title': 'Someone pass this to me while I was eating alone at Woodlands', 'body': 'It is actually an Irony for you to say this because Christian claim they are the only true religion and they alone know the truth and reject all Muslims, Buddhist and even Catholics.

Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\\n\\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son.

(Your local Christian bookstore can suggest some books that describe cults in more detail.)\\n\\nOne characteristic is that cults reject the basic beliefs of the Christian faith–beliefs that Christians have held in common for almost 2,000 years. Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\\n\\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son.

(Your local Christian bookstore can suggest some books that describe cults in more detail.)\\\\n\\\\nOne characteristic is that cults reject the basic beliefs of the Christian faith–beliefs that Christians have held in common for almost 2,000 years. Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\\\\n\\\\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son. The Bible says, “Through him you believe in God … so your faith and hope are in God” (1 Peter 1:21).'}, 't1_l0gjysv': {'author': 'SnooDingos316', 'datetime': 1713625889.0, 'permalink': '/r/singapore/comments/1c8g16i/someone_pass_this_to_me_while_i_was_eating_alone/l0gjysv/', 'score': 4, 'subreddit': 'singapore', 'post_title': 'Someone pass this to me while I was eating alone at Woodlands', 'body': 'It is actually an Irony for you to say this because Christian claim they are the only true religion and they alone know the truth and reject all Muslims, Buddhist and even Catholics.

(Your local Christian bookstore can suggest some books that describe cults in more detail.)\\n\\nOne characteristic is that cults reject the basic beliefs of the Christian faith–beliefs that Christians have held in common for almost 2,000 years. Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\\n\\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son. The Bible says, “Through him you believe in God … so your faith and hope are in God” (1 Peter 1:21).'}, 't1_l0gjysv': {'author': 'SnooDingos316', 'datetime': 1713625889.0, 'permalink': '/r/singapore/comments/1c8g16i/someone_pass_this_to_me_while_i_was_eating_alone/l0gjysv/', 'score': 4, 'subreddit': 'singapore', 'post_title': 'Someone pass this to me while I was eating alone at Woodlands', 'body': 'It is actually an Irony for you to say this because Christian claim they are the only true religion and they alone know the truth and reject all Muslims, Buddhist and even Catholics.

(Your local Christian bookstore can suggest some books that describe cults in more detail.)\n\nOne characteristic is that cults reject the basic beliefs of the Christian faith–beliefs that Christians have held in common for almost 2,000 years. Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\n\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son.

(Your local Christian bookstore can suggest some books that describe cults in more detail.)\n\nOne characteristic is that cults reject the basic beliefs of the Christian faith–beliefs that Christians have held in common for almost 2,000 years. Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\n\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son. The Bible says, “Through him you believe in God … so your faith and hope are in God” (1 Peter 1:21).'}, 't1_l0gjysv': {'author': 'SnooDingos316', 'datetime': 1713625889.0, 'permalink': '/r/singapore/comments/1c8g16i/someone_pass_this_to_me_while_i_was_eating_alone/l0gjysv/', 'score': 4, 'subreddit': 'singapore', 'post_title': 'Someone pass this to me while I was eating alone at Woodlands', 'body': 'It is actually an Irony for you to say this because Christian claim they are the only true religion and they alone know the truth and reject all Muslims, Buddhist and even Catholics.

(Your local Christian bookstore can suggest some books that describe cults in more detail.)\n\nOne characteristic is that cults reject the basic beliefs of the Christian faith–beliefs that Christians have held in common for almost 2,000 years. Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\n\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son. The Bible says, “Through him you believe in God … so your faith and hope are in God” (1 Peter 1:21).'}, 't1_l0gjysv': {'author': 'SnooDingos316', 'datetime': 1713625889.0, 'permalink': '/r/singapore/comments/1c8g16i/someone_pass_this_to_me_while_i_was_eating_alone/l0gjysv/', 'score': 4, 'subreddit': 'singapore', 'post_title': 'Someone pass this to me while I was eating alone at Woodlands', 'body': 'It is actually an Irony for you to say this because Christian claim they are the only true religion and they alone know the truth and reject all Muslims, Buddhist and even Catholics.

Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\\n\\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son.

(Your local Christian bookstore can suggest some books that describe cults in more detail.)\\n\\nOne characteristic is that cults reject the basic beliefs of the Christian faith–beliefs that Christians have held in common for almost 2,000 years. Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\\n\\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son.

(Your local Christian bookstore can suggest some books that describe cults in more detail.)\\\\n\\\\nOne characteristic is that cults reject the basic beliefs of the Christian faith–beliefs that Christians have held in common for almost 2,000 years. Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\\\\n\\\\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son. The Bible says, “Through him you believe in God … so your faith and hope are in God” (1 Peter 1:21).'}, 't1_l0gjysv': {'author': 'SnooDingos316', 'datetime': 1713625889.0, 'permalink': '/r/singapore/comments/1c8g16i/someone_pass_this_to_me_while_i_was_eating_alone/l0gjysv/', 'score': 4, 'subreddit': 'singapore', 'post_title': 'Someone pass this to me while I was eating alone at Woodlands', 'body': 'It is actually an Irony for you to say this because Christian claim they are the only true religion and they alone know the truth and reject all Muslims, Buddhist and even Catholics.

(Your local Christian bookstore can suggest some books that describe cults in more detail.)\\n\\nOne characteristic is that cults reject the basic beliefs of the Christian faith–beliefs that Christians have held in common for almost 2,000 years. Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\\n\\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son. The Bible says, “Through him you believe in God … so your faith and hope are in God” (1 Peter 1:21).'}, 't1_l0gjysv': {'author': 'SnooDingos316', 'datetime': 1713625889.0, 'permalink': '/r/singapore/comments/1c8g16i/someone_pass_this_to_me_while_i_was_eating_alone/l0gjysv/', 'score': 4, 'subreddit': 'singapore', 'post_title': 'Someone pass this to me while I was eating alone at Woodlands', 'body': 'It is actually an Irony for you to say this because Christian claim they are the only true religion and they alone know the truth and reject all Muslims, Buddhist and even Catholics.

(Your local Christian bookstore can suggest some books that describe cults in more detail.)\n\nOne characteristic is that cults reject the basic beliefs of the Christian faith–beliefs that Christians have held in common for almost 2,000 years. Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\n\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son.

(Your local Christian bookstore can suggest some books that describe cults in more detail.)\n\nOne characteristic is that cults reject the basic beliefs of the Christian faith–beliefs that Christians have held in common for almost 2,000 years. Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\n\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son. The Bible says, “Through him you believe in God … so your faith and hope are in God” (1 Peter 1:21).'}, 't1_l0gjysv': {'author': 'SnooDingos316', 'datetime': 1713625889.0, 'permalink': '/r/singapore/comments/1c8g16i/someone_pass_this_to_me_while_i_was_eating_alone/l0gjysv/', 'score': 4, 'subreddit': 'singapore', 'post_title': 'Someone pass this to me while I was eating alone at Woodlands', 'body': 'It is actually an Irony for you to say this because Christian claim they are the only true religion and they alone know the truth and reject all Muslims, Buddhist and even Catholics.

(Your local Christian bookstore can suggest some books that describe cults in more detail.)\n\nOne characteristic is that cults reject the basic beliefs of the Christian faith–beliefs that Christians have held in common for almost 2,000 years. Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\n\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son. The Bible says, “Through him you believe in God … so your faith and hope are in God” (1 Peter 1:21).'}, 't1_l0gjysv': {'author': 'SnooDingos316', 'datetime': 1713625889.0, 'permalink': '/r/singapore/comments/1c8g16i/someone_pass_this_to_me_while_i_was_eating_alone/l0gjysv/', 'score': 4, 'subreddit': 'singapore', 'post_title': 'Someone pass this to me while I was eating alone at Woodlands', 'body': 'It is actually an Irony for you to say this because Christian claim they are the only true religion and they alone know the truth and reject all Muslims, Buddhist and even Catholics.

Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\\n\\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son.

(Your local Christian bookstore can suggest some books that describe cults in more detail.)\\n\\nOne characteristic is that cults reject the basic beliefs of the Christian faith–beliefs that Christians have held in common for almost 2,000 years. Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\\n\\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son.

(Your local Christian bookstore can suggest some books that describe cults in more detail.)\\\\n\\\\nOne characteristic is that cults reject the basic beliefs of the Christian faith–beliefs that Christians have held in common for almost 2,000 years. Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\\\\n\\\\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son. The Bible says, “Through him you believe in God … so your faith and hope are in God” (1 Peter 1:21).'}, 't1_l0gjysv': {'author': 'SnooDingos316', 'datetime': 1713625889.0, 'permalink': '/r/singapore/comments/1c8g16i/someone_pass_this_to_me_while_i_was_eating_alone/l0gjysv/', 'score': 4, 'subreddit': 'singapore', 'post_title': 'Someone pass this to me while I was eating alone at Woodlands', 'body': 'It is actually an Irony for you to say this because Christian claim they are the only true religion and they alone know the truth and reject all Muslims, Buddhist and even Catholics.

(Your local Christian bookstore can suggest some books that describe cults in more detail.)\\n\\nOne characteristic is that cults reject the basic beliefs of the Christian faith–beliefs that Christians have held in common for almost 2,000 years. Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\\n\\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son. The Bible says, “Through him you believe in God … so your faith and hope are in God” (1 Peter 1:21).'}, 't1_l0gjysv': {'author': 'SnooDingos316', 'datetime': 1713625889.0, 'permalink': '/r/singapore/comments/1c8g16i/someone_pass_this_to_me_while_i_was_eating_alone/l0gjysv/', 'score': 4, 'subreddit': 'singapore', 'post_title': 'Someone pass this to me while I was eating alone at Woodlands', 'body': 'It is actually an Irony for you to say this because Christian claim they are the only true religion and they alone know the truth and reject all Muslims, Buddhist and even Catholics.

(Your local Christian bookstore can suggest some books that describe cults in more detail.)\n\nOne characteristic is that cults reject the basic beliefs of the Christian faith–beliefs that Christians have held in common for almost 2,000 years. Instead, they say they alone have a full understanding of the truth about God, and the only way to know the truth is to be part of their group. Many cults have their own writings also, which they either substitute for the Bible or add to the Bible.\n\nCults also often have a strong leader–one who demands total obedience, and actually claims to speak for God. This is very dangerous, of course, because he or she may lead others into disaster. Remember: Only Christ is worthy of our allegiance, for only He is God’s Son.
