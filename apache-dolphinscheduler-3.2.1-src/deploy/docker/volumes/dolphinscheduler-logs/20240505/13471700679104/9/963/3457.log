Treasury's general counsel, Neil MacBride, will also be on the trip.\n\nThe visit comes as Treasury has increased its focus on terrorist financing through Southeast Asia, including through fundraising efforts and illicit Iranian oil sales, the source said.\n\nThe Treasury Department in December imposed sanctions on four Malaysia-based companies it accused of being fronts supporting Iran's production of drones.\n\nWashington has recently imposed further sanctions targeting Iran, including over Iranian drones used by Russian in the war in Ukraine, as the U.S. has sought to ratchet up pressure on Tehran after its attack on Israel.\n\nWhile in Singapore, Nelson will discuss the enforcement of a G7-led price cap on Russian oil as well as cutting off the transshipment of critical dual-use goods, those which have both civilian and military purposes, said the source.\n\nThe United States and its allies have imposed sanctions on thousands of targets since Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine. The war has seen tens of thousands killed and cities destroyed.\n\nWashington has since sought to crack down on evasion of the Western measures, including the shipment of dual-use goods through third countries to Russia.\n\nSingapore is a major shipping hub. Insurance and other maritime service providers operating in Singapore have warned of evasion of the price cap on Russian oil, complaining that it is difficult to confirm that paperwork promising oil is bought at or below the $60 cap is accurate.\n\nThe G7 price cap on Russian crude oil, imposed in December 2022, aims to reduce Russia's revenues available for its war in Ukraine by allowing Western-supplied insurance and other services only on cargoes priced below $60 a barrel.\n\n(Reporting by Daphne Psaledakis; Additional reporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by Don Durfee and Leslie Adler)", "authors": ["Daphne Psaledakis"], "publisher_href": "https://www.yahoo.com"}|{"title": "With PGA Championship defense on the horizon, Brooks Koepka leads by three at LIV Golf Singapore 2024 - Golfweek", "datetime": "Sat, 04 May 2024 17:14:00 GMT", "description": "With PGA Championship defense on the horizon, Brooks Koepka leads by three at LIV Golf Singapore 2024  Golfweek2024 LIV Golf Singapore: Brooks Koepka holds three-stroke lead in final start before PGA Championship defense  CBS SportsLIV Golf Singapore Rd. 2: Koepka leads by 3; Smash up 1  LIV Golf", "url": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZ29sZndlZWsudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDQvbGl2LWdvbGYtc2luZ2Fwb3JlLTIwMjQtYnJvb2tzLWtvZXBrYS1sZWFkZXJib2FyZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en", "context": "Brooks Koepka was open about his putting woes earlier this week: \u201cI can\u2019t find the hole at all, to be honest with you,\u201d he added. \u201cSomething we\u2019ve just been putting some work into, so trying to find some answers.\u201d\n\nWell, it looks like he\u2019s figured something out as he leads by three with 18 holes to play at LIV Golf Singapore at Sentosa Golf Club.\n\nHe made three straight birdies on Nos. 4-6 and added four more on his back nine to sign for a 7-under 64 on the par-71 layout.\n\nWith the PGA Championship at Valhalla less than two weeks away, Koepka is rounding into form just in time for his title defense.\n\nThomas Pieters, Adrian Meronk, Abraham Ancer and Matthew Wolff are tied for second at 9 under.\n\nOn the team side, Smash GC holds a one-shot lead at 23 under over Ripper GC.", "authors": ["Riley Hamel", "May", "Pm Et"], "publisher_href": "https://golfweek.usatoday.com"})
