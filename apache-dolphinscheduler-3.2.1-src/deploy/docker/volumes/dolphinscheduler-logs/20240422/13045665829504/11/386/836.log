First of all, he shouldn't have let his kid be the last one to cross. The kid should always have an adult beside or behind to pay attention to the surroundings because you can't rely on the kid. Next is worst, he totally didn't bother checking on the kid. If you watch carefully, it was a stranger who helped the kid. The adult just went direct to the driver once he saw someone was helping his kid or assumed that his kid was fine."}, 't1_l0ltz6x': {'author': 'deleted', 'datetime': 1713713088.0, 'permalink': '/r/singapore/comments/1c9itat/21apr2024_orchard_road_camcar_turning_right_into/l0ltz6x/', 'score': 0, 'subreddit': 'singapore', 'post_title': '21apr2024 orchard road camcar turning right into centrepoint get tbone by cyclist', 'body': '[deleted]'}, 't1_l0lub0j': {'author': 'clusterfuvk', 'datetime': 1713713209.0, 'permalink': '/r/singapore/comments/1c9itat/21apr2024_orchard_road_camcar_turning_right_into/l0lub0j/', 'score': 1, 'subreddit': 'singapore', 'post_title': '21apr2024 orchard road camcar turning right into centrepoint get tbone by cyclist', 'body': 'Brother, he literally did, I mentioned it in my edit'}, 't1_l0lsd5a': {'author': 'nprogrammer', 'datetime': 1713712490.0, 'permalink': '/r/singapore/comments/1c9itat/21apr2024_orchard_road_camcar_turning_right_into/l0lsd5a/', 'score': 6, 'subreddit': 'singapore', 'post_title': '21apr2024 orchard road camcar turning right into centrepoint get tbone by cyclist', 'body': 'I don’t think it matters whether or not the driver signaled.

Also, to minimise the chance of a tailgating car crashing into him.   \n• He has sufficient time to see the cyclists already in the midst of crossing and instead of horning, should slow down more or just let them cross without the need to horn unnecessarily. Is he in a terrible rush of time? \n\n  \nOn the cyclist part, never let the youngest be at the extreme back of the group. It is irresponsible parenting and will definitely be shamed for it.
