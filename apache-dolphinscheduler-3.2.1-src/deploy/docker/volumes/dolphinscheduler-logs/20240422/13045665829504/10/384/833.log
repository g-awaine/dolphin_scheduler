He moved fm city to city overseas over the past decade, and is now returning to Singapore to start the SG branch. \\n\\nI heard that he is looking for housing in SG for his family. Apparently, he’s looking to rent a family-sized condo unit somewhere in district 9, 10, 11. I questioned since he’s a Singaporean, why can’t he just buy a HDB flat, or rent a flat in the meantime? I was told this housing is provided by the church. \\n\\nIsn’t there something so wrong in principles here? This mega church is getting 10% of income from their followers, and this is channeled to fund their pastor for his lux living in a family-sized condo in a prime district. Whereas the church followers are prob mostly Singaporeans who are living simply in HDB flats, who have to contribute 10% of their income every month, part of which is to fund their pastor’s living expenses.

There is one ultimate financial beneficiary owner who is not accountable to anyone. So essentially a business for that person. \\n\\nNew age churches also make their members commit to tithes in writing and they follow up on arrears just like credit card companies. The cell leader will also follow up. The Catholic church and all demonisations of the mainstream Christian groups such as the Baptist, Methodist etc, do not do this. All donations are voluntary.  \\n\\nThey hide behind a country's recognition of main stream religion and many of these countries have the religious recognition and tolerance enshrined in their constitution which makes it difficult to challenge. \\n\\nMany have large number of followers are all of them without exception support the current establishment. So politically they become captured voters for the ruling party. Its has become symbiotic relationship. If argument sake if the WP wins GE and becomes the ruling party, new age churches will immediately switch as it is convenient for them.\"}, 't1_l0klpqp': {'author': 'weisze', 'datetime': 1713689723.0, 'permalink': '/r/singapore/comments/1c99upm/singapore_churches_that_adopts_cultlike_practices/l0klpqp/', 'score': 3, 'subreddit': 'singapore', 'post_title': 'Singapore churches that adopts cult-like practices.

Speaking in tongues during a session, sounded like crazy people\n\n\n3. Attended 2nd session because of friends. One person who was a church friend of my friend, asked me how I thought about the first session, to which I said fun because it's like a concert. Then she got angry when I can't ans her questions on what the pastor said last service and showed me her long ass notes. Wtf.\n\n\n4. Everything the pastor said, all will reply AMEN. Like possessed like that, creepy.\n\n\n5. Social media of attendees all about the church. Pastor's birthdays confirm will post. Like they are the centre of their lives. Pretty weird. Tbh posts usually church mates, like they dont have other friends outside of church.\n\n\nMy friend is still active in hogc. I have distanced myself from her.

I was horny as a teen. \n\nSo I joined her cell group and I learned quite a few things about them. This was in early 2000s before their move to Suntec, they were based in Expo then. \n\nMy first impression was wow wtf big concert, people jumping around in this dark hall with flashing lights, loud music, a band playing with big screens everywhere, people \'moshing\' in the middle etc. It was all very professional, there was an usher system with even emergency services standing by at the side in case. \n\nIt was insane because the church I was more familiar with was the old white hair pastor reading from bible verses in slow paced, mono-toned voice while other old people also chanted in repeat etc (St. Andrews Cathedral). Youth services wasn\'t that common back then. You went from Sunday school to Adult section straight away. \n\nThe \'sus\' moment came when they invited me to join them for dinner at the nearby hawker centre after service.\n\nI was very new to the group then and the cell group leader came up to me and said "Hey xxx can you bless the group today". I was like what the fuck does that mean, you mean say grace? \n\nHe laughed and explained that blessing means, paying for the group. This mother fucker wanted me, this kid to pay for 5 people\'s meal. I told him HAHA NO I DON\'T HAVE ANY MONEY TO PAY FOR EVERYONES MEAL. His face instantly changed from smiley smiley to serious mode and said eventually everyone has to bless each other and I was being selfish right now. And he was entirely serious about it. I think in the end we compromised and I had to \'bless\' 2 members meal. But that was my last meal with them so I never ever got to get blessed in return but whatever fuck em. \n\nAlso one time I overslept because I played too much Dota at night and I woke up at like 5pm.

The people there can be quite homogenous and tend not to make as much deliberate effort for those that are not as similar to them, but I wouldn\'t say that it stemmed from any doctrinal issues.\n\nSermons typically focus more on the Word, though perhaps the thematic preaching vs expository style preaching already predisposes certain groups of people to "judge" them because modern churches tend to do thematic sermons while some more traditional churches do expository sermons. This might be an inherent bias if you came from other church backgrounds.\n\nThe church does ask people to honor the leaders in church, but this is not a frequently preached message. It does take peer discipleship quite seriously though, so people who are more opposed to that tend to get quite resentful of the message.\n\nETA: ok, brief look at OP\'s post history, apparently they have an axe to grind because their partner is Christian and they are salty because the church is affecting their physical intimacy with their partner.

It's any amount that's close to the heart's desire.\n\nThese days, the moneys collected are for the running of the churches to do ministry work like paying church staff, church utilities, outreach programs, charity works, etc.\n\nSome church leaders (not anyone in specific) misuse this to benefit their own cause and in some cases, they pressure (soft or hard) the members/congregations to give as much as possible in the name of doing God's work.\n\nThere were famous cases in the past (both in Singapore and abroad) where they said that God wouldn't bless you if you don't give more money.\n\nHaving said all these, not all churches act the same.

Secondly, they performed what we would now call governmental functions like administration and law enforcement.

And yes, will tell you how special they are (selected by God!) but not the others who attend other churches/demonition and cannot mix with them too. \n\nAlso those Prosperity Gospel mega churches who started off small like above. Basically those originating and similar to the American style Evangelical churches - always lead by a pastor who tells you God/Holy Spirit spoke to them to start their church. They\'re very MLM in their app, from getting tiths, 10%, from you, to recruiting members. Both have similar practices \n\nAnd yes, every one of the them tick the boxes on your listing above.\n\nYap, been invited to and attended at least half a dozen or more over the years, usually with colleagues/friends persistent urging. Usually find their sermons/preaching uncomfortable and their interpretation or rather, misinterpretation of the Bible disturbing. \n\nWent to Catholic based school and church, did Bible studies from Genesis to Revelations, went to Methodist Church for most of my life and returned to it after above experiences. Now, not really attending church any more. Will attend traditional if I feel like it but avoid any of these culty ones like the plague which they are. \n\nI mentioned above because I feel like many of these try to attract people who are new to Christianity and probably have never read the Bible from Old to New Testament, or don\'t have a good grounding or understanding of it, and thus, are easily influenced and believe whatever these self-appointed pastors spout, or twist and misinterprete the Gospel. And telling them they\'re specially chosen messengers of God and will be the special tribe that goes to Heaven. And always, the Devil is tempting them or leading them astray if they question or doubt.\n\nAlso, speaking in tongues. And being "touched by the Holy Spirit" falling and fainting stuff.
