Gan, 65, will also take Wong's job as chair of the board of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the central bank said.\\\\n\\\\nWong will retain the finance portfolio and takes over on Wednesday from 72-year-old Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.

The last significant shakeup came in April 2021, after Lee's anointed successor Heng Swee Keat ruled himself out of Singapore's top job.\\\\n\\\\nWong took over in the finance portfolio and other key next-generation leaders were also given fresh portfolios.\\\\n\\\\nHeng, who has been deputy prime minister since 2019, will remain in the post serving under Wong.\\\\n\\\\n(Reporting by Xinghui Kok; Editing by Martin Petty)\\\", \\\"authors\\\": [\\\"Xinghui Kok\\\"], \\\"publisher_href\\\": \\\"https://www.yahoo.com\\\"}\",\"topic\":\"'Singapore'\"}"}, taskDependType=TASK_POST, failureStrategy=CONTINUE, warningType=NONE, warningGroupId=0, scheduleTime=null, startTime=Tue May 14 11:45:49 GMT+08:00 2024, processInstancePriority=MEDIUM, updateTime=Tue May 14 11:45:49 GMT+08:00 2024, workerGroup=default, tenantCode=null, environmentCode=null, dryRun=0, processInstanceId=1117, processDefinitionVersion=31, testFlag=0)
