A decade ago, it was too damn often people fart so loud in public. Be it MRT, bus, lift or the freaking meeting room where we had to smell ass-breath for an hour. I had a manager who farts mid-speech so loud and continues on as if that's such a normal thing. Somehow, this behaviour seems to have vanished (have not encountered one in years thank god). \n\nThen uncles using phone speakers to listen to loud movies/music  in public seems to have reduced in frequency as well. At least I believe it has because I wouldn't know. I'm always wearing noise cancelling earphones when I am outside, unless I'm traveling with a friend or family. However, this could also be a generational thing. What's cool for today will be looked at as old and inconsiderate few decades later. When those uncles were young, it was the high fashion to blast music from their massive radios and walkmens etc even in the developed world. World wasn't as silent as it is today a few decades back and it was the cool thing those days. Some people refuse to change with time. Some people dislike earphones because when they were growing up, only those people who were hearing impaired wore earbuds looking hearing aids. And old people stubbornly refuse to give up these prejudices in their old age. \n\nFor my own sanity, I've decided to be creative when it comes to how I want the world to be. People don't wash hands after using washroom and open door? I carry a packet of tissues, use one to hold the door handle and open the door.  Outside too noisy, use my noise cancelling earphones. Someone farts in the public transport, I alight, and take the next ride. Boss farts in the meeting room, I get a stomach ache and excuse myself out of there (helps that I'm lactose intolerant and can fake a stomachache anytime I want)."}, 't1_kyaiqxr': {'author': 'hoeconna', 'datetime': 1712387320.0, 'permalink': '/r/singapore/comments/1bwwnyk/it_should_be_a_crime_with_heavy_fine_to_use_phone/kyaiqxr/', 'score': 1, 'subreddit': 'singapore', 'post_title': 'It should be a crime with heavy fine to use phone loudly', 'body': 'Time to throw some punches:)'}, 't1_kyajii3': {'author': 'Dorkdogdonki', 'datetime': 1712387857.0, 'permalink': '/r/singapore/comments/1bwwnyk/it_should_be_a_crime_with_heavy_fine_to_use_phone/kyajii3/', 'score': 1, 'subreddit': 'singapore', 'post_title': 'It should be a crime with heavy fine to use phone loudly', 'body': 'This is why ANC is so useful.
