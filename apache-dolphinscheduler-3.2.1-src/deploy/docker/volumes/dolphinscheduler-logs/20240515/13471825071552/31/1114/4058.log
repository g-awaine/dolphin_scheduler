Soon after, his video went viral on the social media platform TikTok, where the majority of locals warned him against conflating two different identities.\n\nSimilarly, another user, who is from China, shared a video showing how people in Singapore might have \u201cforgotten their culture\u201d. He also revealed he was shocked to learn that Singaporeans were cold on being considered \u201ccompatriots\u201d with mainlanders.\n\nNow, clips are being shared online highlighting Singaporeans' frustration over being called Chinese.\n\nOne user commented on the video and said, \"Singaporean Chinese admit they are Chinese. They just hate [for] people to think they are from China.\u201d\n\nAnother user added how people in Singapore wanted to disassociate themselves from the Chinese because of their \"bad habits\".\n\n\u201cChinese nationals travelling and visiting places no doubt created a bad image for themselves, such as: talking loudly, [having] no manners and bad habits,\u201d he said.\n\nThe majority of the population in Singapore is ethnically Chinese. The population of 4 million compromises 74 per cent Chinese, 13 per cent Malays and 9 per cent Indians.\n\nAccording to experts, Singapore suffers from this identity crisis and the debate of being Chinese vs Singaporean is not new.\n\n\u201cFor a long time, Singapore has been confused as being a part of China and that comes mainly from Europe and North American societies \u2026 That primarily is because the two share a significant similarity in heritage and Singapore being a majority-Chinese country, so there is that tendency to perceive it as an allegiance,\u201d Leong Chan-Hoong, a senior fellow for social cohesion research at the Nanyang Technological University\u2019s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, was quoted as saying by South China Morning Post.\n\nThis debate has also annoyed some Singaporean lawmakers, one of whom said in the parliament last month that the cultural ties between the two nations \"should not be the only way to view relations between both sides.\"\n\n\u201cSingaporeans are citizens of an independent country, but may also identify culturally with being ethnically Chinese, Malay, Indian or others. National identity and cultural identity are two different matters,\u201d Sim Ann, a senior minister of state in Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had said.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)", "authors": ["Vikrant Singh"], "publisher_href": "https://www.wionews.com"}|{"title": "Malaysia's Johor eyes Shenzhen-style hub with Singapore, report says - The Japan Times", "datetime": "Mon, 13 May 2024 06:21:00 GMT", "description": "Malaysia's Johor eyes Shenzhen-style hub with Singapore, report says  The Japan Times", "url": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphcGFudGltZXMuY28uanAvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyNC8wNS8xMy9tYWxheXNpYS1zaGVuemhlbi1odWItc2luZ2Fwb3JlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en", "context": "Malaysia\u2019s Johor state is proposing its economic and petrochemical hubs as the sites for a special zone with neighbor Singapore, as it aims to become the \"Shenzhen of Southeast Asia,\" according to a report in the Star.\n\nThe suggested area will comprise Iskandar Malaysia and Pengerang on the east coast of the state, Johor Menteri Besar Onn Hafiz Ghazi was cited as saying at the state assembly on Sunday.

Gan, 65, will also take Wong's job as chair of the board of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the central bank said.\n\nWong will retain the finance portfolio and takes over on Wednesday from 72-year-old Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Lee, the son of the founding father of modern Singapore Lee Kuan Yew, will remain in cabinet as senior minister, in accordance with tradition.\n\n\"Continuity and stability are key considerations, especially as we are approaching the end of this term of government,\" Wong told a press conference attended by local media.\n\nThe reshuffle was minor and included the promotion of several junior ministers plus the appointed of two parliamentary backbenchers to junior ministerial positions.\n\nSingapore must hold its next general election by November 2025, at which Wong will lead the People's Action Party (PAP), which has ruled the wealthy city-state since 1959.\n\nWong is among 15 senior PAP members referred to locally as 4G leaders, a fourth generation that was hand-picked to succeed Lee and his cabinet for a carefully calibrated transition of power in the Asian financial hub.\n\nWong has said he would make bigger changes to his cabinet after the election.\n\nMajor cabinet reshuffles are infrequent in Singapore. The last significant shakeup came in April 2021, after Lee's anointed successor Heng Swee Keat ruled himself out of Singapore's top job.\n\nWong took over in the finance portfolio and other key next-generation leaders were also given fresh portfolios.\n\nHeng, who has been deputy prime minister since 2019, will remain in the post serving under Wong.\n\n(Reporting by Xinghui Kok; Editing by Martin Petty)", "authors": ["Xinghui Kok"], "publisher_href": "https://www.yahoo.com"}'}, Property{prop='article_data_hash', direct=IN, type=VARCHAR, value='7e304a8b6b86b90488300e49550182a5112ffc25e00e733ca370cdd3c8f8849b'}, Property{prop='article_data', direct=IN, type=VARCHAR, value='{'title': 'Singapore has achieved astounding economic success - The Economist', 'datetime': 'Wed, 08 May 2024 10:58:08 GMT', 'description': "Singapore has achieved astounding economic success  The EconomistLawrence Wong set to take centre stage as Singapore’s new prime minister  Al Jazeera EnglishSingapore's New PM Faces Some Economic Headwinds  Bloomberg", 'url': 'https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vYXNpYS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L3NpbmdhcG9yZS1oYXMtYWNoaWV2ZWQtYXN0b3VuZGluZy1lY29ub21pYy1zdWNjZXNz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en', 'context': 'S ince its independence almost 60 years ago, Singapore has become a beacon of prosperity.
