Saab panic after clipping merc (who sped up to prevent overtaking). \n2. Saab went crazy fast after clipping as if to escape confrontation. \n\nI’m betting saab driver was distracted (likely eyes on rear view mirror),  checking merc reaction  before ploughing through the junction. Looking at the force of the Saab during the accident, No one sane will cheong thru a junction full of vehicles.

	{"user":"BearbearDarling","content":"> It would have happen with or without the Merc driver. \n\nYeah, we really don't know that. Yes, the saab was speeding to begin with. But to say a speeding driver will surely beat red light and cause a collision down the road is pure speculation. There are speeding vehicles on the road everyday who don't get into accidents. Moreover, the saab displayed some control by maneuvering and switching lanes trying to overtake. He didn't just crash into the rear of the merc. He didn't barrel over the motorbike. That shows some control on his part even if he was driving dangerously. Versus his conduct at the cross junction where he just plows straight through like a bullet. There is some contrast in his behavior.\n\nThe merc provoking the ssab by speeding up to in attempt to block the overtaking and the saab clipping the merc are not insignificant events. It's possible that they had an effect on the saab driver's state of mind. He could have become blinded with rage and tried to floor it to hit and run. Even so, I think that the merc cannot be legally liable for the collisions at the junction. But you can't tell me the merc is completely uninvolved as if he was a mere bystander. And the worst thing is two lives are lost. One cannot help but wonder if the merc had simply let the saab go on its way, perhaps what happened at the junction might have been different.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1cau62k/screenshot_of_snh7z_drivers_alleged_self/l0uny28/","context":"Screenshot of SNH7Z Driver's alleged \"Self Justification\"","score":1,"subreddit":"singapore","type":"comment","id":"l0uny28","datetime":"2024-04-23 13:47:50"}
