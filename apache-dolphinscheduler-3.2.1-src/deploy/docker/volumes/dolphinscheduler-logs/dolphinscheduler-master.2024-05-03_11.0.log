He allegedly deleted 700 photos from his phone, which he told police he had taken in the six months leading up to the incident.\\n\\nThe Tokyo police are investigating potential violations of child pornography laws and are planning to ask Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) to have the man turn himself in, said Asahi. Formal charges are also being considered.\\n\\nThe diplomat has been dismissed as a counsellor but is immune to arrest in accordance with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which states that diplomats cannot be arrested or detained in a country they have been dispatched to.\\n\\nWhen asked by the Asahi newspaper on Thursday, the embassy was reportedly unaware of the public bath incident.
