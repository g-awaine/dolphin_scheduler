    "context": "Brooks Koepka was open about his putting woes earlier this week: \u201cI can\u2019t find the hole at all, to be honest with you,\u201d he added. \u201cSomething we\u2019ve just been putting some work into, so trying to find some answers.\u201d\n\nWell, it looks like he\u2019s figured something out as he leads by three with 18 holes to play at LIV Golf Singapore at Sentosa Golf Club.\n\nHe made three straight birdies on Nos. 4-6 and added four more on his back nine to sign for a 7-under 64 on the par-71 layout.\n\nWith the PGA Championship at Valhalla less than two weeks away, Koepka is rounding into form just in time for his title defense.\n\nThomas Pieters, Adrian Meronk, Abraham Ancer and Matthew Wolff are tied for second at 9 under.\n\nOn the team side, Smash GC holds a one-shot lead at 23 under over Ripper GC.",
